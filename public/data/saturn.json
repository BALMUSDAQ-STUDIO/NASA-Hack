  "desc": "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is well-known for its stunning rings, which are composed of ice particles, rocky debris, and dust. It is the second-largest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of about **116,460 kilometers** (about **72,366 miles**), making it a gas giant like Jupiter. Saturn's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases, giving it a pale yellow color. The planet has a complex weather system, featuring high-speed winds and storms. Saturn has a large number of moons, with at least **83 confirmed**, including Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury and has a dense atmosphere. A day on Saturn lasts about **10.7 hours**, while it takes approximately **29.5 Earth years** to complete one orbit around the Sun.",
