  "desc": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is classified as an ice giant due to its unique composition, which includes water, ammonia, and methane ice. It has a diameter of about **50,724 kilometers** (about **31,518 miles**), making it the third-largest planet in the solar system. Uranus is notable for its distinctive blue-green color, caused by the presence of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. \n\nOne of the most striking features of Uranus is its extreme axial tilt of about **98 degrees**, which means it essentially rolls along its orbit, resulting in unusual seasonal variations. The planet has a faint ring system and at least **27 known moons**, with the largest being Titania, Oberon, Miranda, Ariel, and Umbriel. A day on Uranus lasts about **17.2 hours**, while it takes approximately **84 Earth years** to complete one orbit around the Sun.",
