  "desc": "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is classified as a gas giant. It is known for its massive size, having a diameter of about **139,822 kilometers** (86,881 miles), which is more than 11 times that of Earth. Jupiter has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, along with trace amounts of methane, ammonia, and water vapor. It is famous for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and an extensive system of rings, as well as at least **79 known moons**, including the four largest, known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. A day on Jupiter lasts about **10 hours**, while its orbital period around the Sun is approximately **12 Earth years**.",
